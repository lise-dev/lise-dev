# Hi there 👋 I'm Lise

🎓 I’m a final-year Computer Engineering student passionate about **Data Analysis, Dashboards, and Machine Learning**.  

🌍 My journey has taken me from **France 🇫🇷** to **Spain 🇪🇸**, **Canada 🇨🇦**, and now **Norway 🇳🇴**, combining international experience with technical growth.   

📊 Currently, I’m focusing on **data dashboards**, designing tools to represent and analyze data in a clear, actionable way.  

🌱 Alongside this, I’m completing a [**MOOC on Responsible Digital Technology**](https://institutnr.org/certificat-de-connaissance-nr), which will lead to an official certification.  

🚀 I’m actively looking for an **internship in data analysis and dashboard development** to apply these skills.  


🏔️🧘‍♀️ When I’m not coding, you’ll find me hiking  or practicing yoga.
